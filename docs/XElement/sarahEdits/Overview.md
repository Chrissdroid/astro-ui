# XElement

Welcome to the home of XElement, an Astro **Customisable HTML Web Component Generator**.

XElement allows you to create dynamic HTML elements *enhanced* with interactivity (e.g. animations, transitions, event listeners) natively on an Astro page or in a component...

All without the need for writing a component in one of the many JavaScript frameworks Astro supports (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact).

XElement web components give you the option to choose *when* and *how* to run JavaScript or TypeScript on the client-side on a per-element basis.

Unlike other framework components, XElement-generated components can even contain other framework components. This allows you to combine with other frameworks, expanding Astro and component design with some very interesting results.

At it's core is the ability for you to create all these kinds of wonderful components to work effortlessly with Astro, all from a single intuitive interface, collocation like you have never experienced.

----------

## Getting Started

1. Add `XElement` to your Astro project via the terminal

2. Import `XElement` into any `.astro` file (page, layout, or component):

```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-XElement'

```

That is it, you are now ready to start using `XElement`!
