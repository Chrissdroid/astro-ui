# XElement

Welcome to the home of XElement, **Astro's first and only* HTML Web Component Framework**

XElement allows you to create dynamic HTML elements with interactivity (e.g. animations, transitions, event listeners) natively in an Astro page or component... without the need for writing and importing a component in one of the many JavaScript frameworks Astro supports (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact).

XElement creates web components. It also gives you the option to choose *when* and *how* to run **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, client-side on a per-component basis. Very similar to the way Astro controls the hydration of framework components via `client:*` directives.

Unlike other framework components, XElement-generated components can even contain other framework components. This allows you to combine the outputs of otherwise isolated islands of interactivity.

----------

## Getting Started

1. Add XElement to your Astro project via the terminal

```bash
npm i astro-xelement -D
```

2. Import XElement into any `.astro` file (page, layout, or component):

```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-XElement'
---
```

That is it, you are now ready to start using XElement! Choose your next step...

## Induction
