# `XElement` API

Welcome to our **API** section of the documentation, here you will find all you need to know about `XElement` API's, what they are, how they work and most importantly how to use it correctly.

The API that we have implemented into `XElement` is designed to be as intuitive as possible, without trying to impose any *new* forms of expression into your knowledge base.

There are a few rules in regards to the syntax and what goes in what and where. These will make sense when you come to using them. Otherwise you will be tripping up over `TypeErrors` and being flustered as a result.

This in our eyes is something that we really want to help prevent and provide you with an all round happy experience when you are using `XElement`

For a happy developer is a productive developer.

## How to use

For each type of behaviour we use, we aim to have a separate set of pages to explain them in some more detail.

For **HTML Tags** and information relating to the types of elements you can make, you can find out more information here

Information pertaining to `XElements` **Observers** is found here

Everything about Event Listeners and how to engage them with `XElement`, is located here

We will include any references to relevant external resource that we use at the bottom of each page, letting you explore in more detail and to get as much of the information that you need to you as possible.
