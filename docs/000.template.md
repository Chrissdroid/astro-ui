# Astro-UI Docs Template

Each Component created within the Astro-ui monorepo needs to have its own accompanying set of documents to provide extra contextual information on

- The Component
- What it is
- What it does
- How it does it
- How to use it
- When and Where to use it

These pages will have a shared Template, where FrontMatter tags are shared between the pages and their respective frontend Astro site.

## FrontMatter Template

This is the Template that would be placed at the top of the front-matter of each doc page.

```astro

title: ""
meta_title: ""
description: ""
meta_description: ""
order: 0
next_page: ''
previous_page: ""
